# Agent Notes

## Project Shape

- This package is a Pi extension that registers a `litellm` provider from `src/index.ts`.
- Source is TypeScript ESM under `src/`; tests are Vitest specs under `tests/`.
- Build output is `dist/`; do not edit generated output by hand or publish it.
- Git and npm installs load `./src/index.ts` through `package.json` `pi.extensions`.
- Node support starts at `>=22.19.0`; GitHub workflows currently run Node `26.5.0`.

## Commands

- Use `npm ci` when reinstalling dependencies from the lockfile.
- Use `npm test` for the full test suite.
- Use `npm test -- tests/<file>.test.ts` for a focused Vitest run.
- Use `npm run check` before committing code changes; it runs Biome, typecheck, tests, and the package-content guard.
- Use `npm run clean && npm run build` when changing exported/runtime code.
- Use `npm run supply-chain:guard` and `npm pack --dry-run` when package contents, dependency policy, or release packaging change.

## Discovery And Credentials

- Model discovery lives in `src/discover.ts`; pure deployment-group reduction lives in `src/model-groups.ts`.
- Shared thinking-level definitions and map intersection live in `src/thinking-levels.ts`.
- Prefer `/model/info` for rich metadata. Use `/v1/models` as the status-code fallback only when `/model/info`
  returns 401, 403, or 404; after a successful `/model/info`, also query `/v1/models` only to expand wildcard routes.
- Treat `model_name` as a public route group, not backend evidence. Resolve backend identity from
  `model_info.base_model` before `litellm_params.model`; treat `custom_llm_provider` as provider evidence, withholding
  identity when a non-generic provider conflicts with the model prefix. Reduce every deployment before choosing
  transport, capabilities, limits, prices, or catalog authority; never shallow-merge duplicate route rows.
- Keep catalog lookup provider-aware. Unqualified or conflicting identities must not scan every Pi provider catalog.
- The `/v1/models` fallback and a health-only `/health` entry take protocol from the matching Pi catalog model:
  `openai-responses` selects Responses, while every other or missing catalog API selects Chat. For a health-only entry,
  the route name authorizes nothing but that catalog-supplied transport; levels stay denied and no catalog metadata is
  granted. The `/v1/models` fallback may enrich its other metadata from that bounded catalog lookup.
- ` (no metadata)` is the fallback-only cache enrichment marker. Reduced `/model/info` groups and health-only `/health`
  entries use ` (incomplete metadata)`, which must remain ineligible for route-name cache enrichment.
- Keep `LITELLM_OFFLINE` and `LITELLM_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` behavior compatible with README docs.
- Stored Pi `/login litellm` credentials take precedence over `LITELLM_API_KEY`.
- Pi stores discovered models in `models-store.json`; models.dev enrichment uses `litellm-models-dev.json` with a
  28-day cache window under the Pi agent dir.
- Pi owns discovered-model persistence in `models-store.json`; this extension does not write a model cache. Legacy `litellm-models.json` model caches are ignored and never deleted. `litellm-models-dev.json` is the models.dev cache and is refreshed in place.
- Google ADC is resolved in process through `src/gcloud-token.ts`; there is no helper subprocess and no `src/gcloud-token-cli.ts`. Only `authorized_user` credentials are supported, and service accounts warn and fail closed.
- `apiKey.check` performs no network call, so it reports credential shape, not mintability. Its source label must mirror the precedence in `resolveCredentials`, so ADC is named whenever a complete ADC file exists; if the refresh token no longer mints, `resolve` falls back and reports the credential it actually used.

## LiteLLM Request Hooks

- `before_provider_request` is a global Pi hook. Only mutate provider payloads when `ctx.model?.provider` matches a configured LiteLLM provider name.
- Do not add user-facing flags or environment variables to hide provider-scoping bugs.
- `before_provider_headers` sends Pi's canonical session id as `x-litellm-session-id`, scoped to the configured LiteLLM provider names; no session field is added to request bodies.
- Kimi/Moonshot responses may include `<think>` text; Pi-visible normalization happens in the `message_end` hook and should stay covered by feature tests.

## Compatibility Rules

- Provider-specific request compatibility belongs in discovered model `compat` metadata, not broad runtime mutation.
- Kimi/Moonshot-style models are handled in `buildCompat()`; keep regression tests with model discovery changes.
- Anthropic-backed aliases need `cacheControlFormat: "anthropic"` so Pi forwards prompt-cache markers through LiteLLM.

## Smoke And CI

- CI runs `npm ci` and `npm run prepublishOnly`; release relies on `npm publish` invoking `prepublishOnly`.
- `.github/workflows/litellm-smoke.yml` uses VidaiMock plus a real LiteLLM proxy; it should not require real provider API keys.
- Keep smoke readiness probes bounded with `curl --connect-timeout 1 --max-time 3`.
- `scripts/smoke-runner.ts` exercises discovery and `/v1/chat/completions` through the proxy.
- The non-interactive Pi CLI smoke loads the package root (`-e .`) so it exercises `pi.extensions` resolution; the interactive terminal smoke loads `src/index.ts` by path.
- `--list-models` alone does not prove an extension loaded, because Pi also reports models from its own store. Assert a load-specific side effect instead.

## Release And Packaging

- The release workflow is tag-driven for `v*.*.*`; it publishes with `npm publish --access public --provenance` and creates a GitHub release.
- Local release prep should keep `package.json` and `package-lock.json` versions in sync, build `dist/`, run package checks, and create only local commits/tags unless the user explicitly overrides the no-push rule.
- Verify released state with `gh release view <tag>` and `npm view pi-provider-litellm version dist-tags --json` after the user pushes the tag.
- The npm package should stay limited to `src`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`; builds are verification-only.
- `scripts/supply-chain-guard.ts` rejects install lifecycle scripts, runtime dependencies, non-registry specs, non-registry lockfile URLs, and unexpected package files, and requires every allowlisted source file to ship; update tests before changing that policy.

## Package Metadata

- Keep the Pi gallery image URL in `package.json` exactly as declared unless the user asks to change it.
- Do not include gallery assets in the npm package unless explicitly requested; verify packaging with `npm pack --dry-run` when package contents change.
