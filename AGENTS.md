# Agent Notes

## Project Shape

- This package is a Pi extension that registers a `litellm` provider from `src/index.ts`.
- Source is TypeScript ESM under `src/`; tests are Vitest specs under `tests/`.
- Build output is `dist/`; do not edit generated output by hand or publish it.
- Git and npm installs load `./src/index.ts` through `package.json` `pi.extensions`.
- Node support starts at `>=22.19.0`; GitHub workflows currently run Node `26.5.0`.

## Commands

- Use `npm ci` when reinstalling dependencies from the lockfile.
- Use `npm test` for the full test suite.
- Use `npm test -- tests/<file>.test.ts` for a focused Vitest run.
- Use `npm run check` before committing code changes; it runs Biome, typecheck, tests, and the package-content guard.
- Use `npm run clean && npm run build` when changing exported/runtime code.
- Use `npm run supply-chain:guard` and `npm pack --dry-run` when package contents, dependency policy, or release packaging change.

## Discovery And Credentials

- Model discovery lives in `src/discover.ts`.
- Prefer `/model/info` for rich metadata; fallback to `/v1/models` only on 401, 403, or 404.
- The `/v1/models` fallback enriches metadata from the Pi catalog and `https://models.dev/api.json`; keep fallback metadata tests current.
- Keep `LITELLM_OFFLINE` and `LITELLM_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` behavior compatible with README docs.
- Stored Pi `/login litellm` credentials take precedence over `LITELLM_API_KEY`.
- Pi owns discovered-model persistence in `models-store.json`; this extension does not write a model cache. Legacy `litellm-models*.json` files are ignored and never deleted.
- The only agent-dir file this extension writes is `litellm-models-dev.json`, a models.dev metadata cache with a 28-day TTL.
- Google ADC is resolved in process through `src/gcloud-token.ts`; there is no helper subprocess and no `src/gcloud-token-cli.ts`. Only `authorized_user` credentials are supported, blank fields are rejected, and service accounts warn and fail closed.
- `apiKey.check` performs no network call, so it reports credential shape, not mintability. Its source label must mirror the precedence in `resolveCredentials`, so ADC is named whenever a complete ADC file exists; if the refresh token no longer mints, `resolve` falls back and reports the credential it actually used.

## LiteLLM Request Hooks

- `before_provider_request` is a global Pi hook. Only mutate provider payloads when `ctx.model?.provider === "litellm"`.
- Do not add user-facing flags or environment variables to hide provider-scoping bugs.
- `litellm_session_id` is optional LiteLLM session grouping metadata. If a LiteLLM server rejects it for LiteLLM-routed requests, keep Pi requests working first and document the admin-facing recommendation separately.
- Kimi/Moonshot responses may include `<think>` text; Pi-visible normalization happens in the `message_end` hook and should stay covered by feature tests.

## Compatibility Rules

- Provider-specific request compatibility belongs in discovered model `compat` metadata, not broad runtime mutation.
- Kimi/Moonshot-style models are handled in `buildCompat()`; keep regression tests with model discovery changes.
- Anthropic-backed aliases need `cacheControlFormat: "anthropic"` so Pi forwards prompt-cache markers through LiteLLM.

## Smoke And CI

- CI runs `npm ci` and `npm run prepublishOnly`.
- The release workflow invokes `npm run prepublishOnly` explicitly before `npm publish`, so the publish gate still runs when npm lifecycle scripts are disabled.
- `.github/workflows/litellm-smoke.yml` uses VidaiMock plus a real LiteLLM proxy; it should not require real provider API keys.
- Keep smoke readiness probes bounded with `curl --connect-timeout 1 --max-time 3`.
- `scripts/smoke-runner.ts` exercises discovery and `/v1/chat/completions` through the proxy.
- The non-interactive Pi CLI smoke loads the package root (`-e .`) so it exercises `pi.extensions` resolution; the interactive terminal smoke loads `src/index.ts` by path.
- `--list-models` alone does not prove an extension loaded, because Pi also reports models from its own store. Assert a load-specific side effect instead.

## Release And Packaging

- The release workflow is tag-driven for `v*.*.*`; it publishes with `npm publish --access public --provenance` and creates a GitHub release.
- Local release prep should keep `package.json` and `package-lock.json` versions in sync, build `dist/`, run package checks, and create only local commits/tags unless the user explicitly overrides the no-push rule.
- Verify released state with `gh release view <tag>` and `npm view pi-provider-litellm version dist-tags --json` after the user pushes the tag.
- The npm package should stay limited to `src`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`; builds are verification-only.
- `scripts/supply-chain-guard.ts` rejects install lifecycle scripts, runtime dependencies, non-registry specs, non-registry lockfile URLs, and unexpected package files, and requires every allowlisted source file to ship; update tests before changing that policy.

## Package Metadata

- Keep the Pi gallery image URL in `package.json` exactly as declared unless the user asks to change it.
- Do not include gallery assets in the npm package unless explicitly requested; verify packaging with `npm pack --dry-run` when package contents change.
