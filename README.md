# pi-provider-litellm

LiteLLM proxy native Provider extension for [Pi](https://pi.dev). Pi 0.81.0+ is required.

Discovers models from self-hosted LiteLLM proxies and registers them under Pi providers. The default provider is `litellm`; optional aliases can register additional LiteLLM providers with separate credentials. Supports `/login litellm`, LiteLLM MCP tools, LiteLLM Skills Gateway prompt injection, and Google ADC token auth. Tries `/model/info` first (admin endpoint with rich metadata), falls back to `/v1/models` (OpenAI-compatible) on 401/403/404, then tries `/health` plus per-endpoint `/model/info` for older LiteLLM proxies.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-provider-litellm
```

Pi fetches the package from npm and registers it. Add `-l` to install into project settings (`.pi/settings.json`) instead of global.

To try it without installing (one-off, current run only):

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-provider-litellm
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: install from source</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balcsida/pi-provider-litellm.git ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-provider-litellm
cd ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-provider-litellm
npm ci
npm run clean && npm run build
```

</details>

## Configure

### Option A — interactive login

Inside pi:

```
/login litellm
```

To configure an API key, run `/login`, choose `Sign in with an API key`, then choose `LiteLLM API key`. With `/login litellm`, choose `Sign in with an API key` directly.

You'll be prompted for the base URL and API key. Credentials are persisted to `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`.

#### Enterprise SSO login

If your LiteLLM proxy requires SSO/OAuth authentication (enterprise deployments), you can authenticate via a browser SSO flow and optionally pair the resulting JWT with a stable virtual key:

1. Run `/login litellm` inside pi and select `Sign in with LiteLLM SSO`
2. Enter the proxy URL
3. Your default browser opens the LiteLLM SSO login URL (e.g. `https://litellm.your-domain.com/sso/key/generate`) automatically — the URL is also displayed in case it can't be opened. Authenticate via SSO
4. Copy your token from the LiteLLM UI and paste it at the prompt (copying a full `Bearer ...` header value is fine — the prefix is stripped automatically)
5. When prompted to generate a virtual key, press Enter to accept (recommended) or enter `n` to use the JWT directly

When you generate a virtual key, the resulting `sk-...` key is stored as your credential and used for all API requests. If the proxy's key policy attaches an expiry to the generated key, Pi will prompt you to re-authenticate when it nears expiry; otherwise the key is treated as permanent until revoked in LiteLLM.

When using a JWT directly, the extension reads its `exp` claim and Pi will prompt you to re-authenticate when the token nears expiry. Run `/login litellm` again to refresh.

### Option B — environment variables

```bash
export LITELLM_BASE_URL="https://litellm.your-domain.com"
export LITELLM_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Stored pi credentials for `litellm` take precedence over `LITELLM_API_KEY`; the environment key is used when no saved credential exists. `LITELLM_BASE_URL` is used when no saved login base URL exists.

### Multiple LiteLLM provider aliases

Add alias providers in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` under `litellm.providers`. Each alias is registered as a separate Pi provider name, so models appear as `litellm/model-id` and `litellm-anthropic/model-id`.

```json
{
  "litellm": {
    "providers": {
      "litellm-anthropic": {
        "baseUrl": "https://litellm.your-domain.com",
        "apiKey": "$LITELLM_CLAUDE_KEY",
        "headers": "$LITELLM_HEADERS"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also override the default provider through the same shape:

```json
{
  "litellm": {
    "providers": {
      "litellm": {
        "baseUrl": "https://litellm.your-domain.com",
        "apiKey": "$LITELLM_API_KEY",
        "headers": "$LITELLM_HEADERS"
      },
      "litellm-anthropic": {
        "baseUrl": "https://litellm.your-domain.com",
        "apiKey": "$LITELLM_CLAUDE_KEY",
        "headers": "$LITELLM_HEADERS"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Provider fields:

| Field | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `baseUrl` | `LITELLM_BASE_URL` for `litellm`; required for aliases | LiteLLM proxy URL, with or without `/v1` |
| `apiKey` | `LITELLM_API_KEY_HELPER`/`LITELLM_API_KEY` for `litellm`; required for aliases | Pi config value for this provider's key. Use `$ENV_VAR`, `${ENV_VAR}`, `!command`, or a literal key. Escape a literal `$` as `$$`. |
| `headers` | `$LITELLM_HEADERS` for `litellm`; unset for aliases | JSON string env reference or inline object of request headers |
| `displayName` | provider name | Label shown in Pi UI |
| `enabled` | `true` | Set `false` to skip an alias |

`/login litellm` and Google ADC token auth remain scoped to the default `litellm` provider. Aliases use their configured `apiKey` or manually stored auth entries matching the alias name.

### Optional LiteLLM features

LiteLLM Skills and MCP integration are enabled by default. Disable either feature globally in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "litellm": {
    "skills": {
      "enabled": false
    },
    "mcp": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

Setting `skills.enabled` to `false` disables the Skills Gateway management tools, skill fetching, and system-prompt injection. Setting `mcp.enabled` to `false` disables LiteLLM MCP discovery and tool registration. Restart Pi after changing these settings so previously registered tools are removed.

## Use

```
/model
```

## Optional environment variables

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `LITELLM_API_KEY_HELPER` | unset | Command that prints a fresh LiteLLM bearer token. Takes precedence over `LITELLM_API_KEY`. Registered as a `!command` provider key; Pi re-runs it on every request (the per-request auth path is uncached), so rotating/short-lived tokens stay fresh. |
| `LITELLM_HEADERS` | unset | JSON object of extra headers sent to LiteLLM provider, discovery, MCP, and Skills Gateway requests. Provider aliases can use it with `"headers": "$LITELLM_HEADERS"`. |
| `LITELLM_GCLOUD_TOKEN_AUTH` | unset | If set to a non-empty value other than `0`, use Google Application Default Credentials as the LiteLLM bearer token source. This takes precedence over `LITELLM_API_KEY_HELPER` and `LITELLM_API_KEY` when no stored `/login litellm` credential exists. |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | Google default ADC path | Optional path to an ADC JSON file used by `LITELLM_GCLOUD_TOKEN_AUTH`. If unset, the extension checks the default gcloud ADC locations. |
| `LITELLM_OFFLINE` | unset | If `1`, disable all model and MCP discovery, including post-login discovery; use cached models only |
| `LITELLM_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | Background and explicit discovery fetch timeout in ms; `0` disables automatic discovery |
| `LITELLM_VERBOSE_DISCOVERY` | unset | If `1`, enable progress messages during model and MCP discovery (login, refresh, startup); discovery is silent by default |
| `LITELLM_MODELS_DEV` | enabled | Set to `0` to disable models.dev metadata enrichment, including its cache and network request; `/v1/models` still uses Pi catalog metadata for provider-qualified ids and conservative defaults otherwise |

`LITELLM_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS=0` disables automatic and explicit refresh model discovery. It does not replace the base URL or API key settings required to send requests when you are not using `/login litellm`.

Models.dev metadata is cached in `litellm-models-dev.json` under the Pi agent directory for 28 days. Fresh data avoids the public request; stale data is used immediately while one background refresh updates the cache. Set `LITELLM_MODELS_DEV=0` when your LiteLLM metadata is authoritative and no external enrichment is wanted.

### Google ADC token auth

When your LiteLLM proxy accepts Google OAuth access tokens, you can let the extension refresh tokens from Application Default Credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
export LITELLM_BASE_URL="https://litellm.your-domain.com"
export LITELLM_GCLOUD_TOKEN_AUTH=1
```

Only `authorized_user` ADC files are supported. Service account JSON files are rejected with a warning. Tokens are cached in memory for 50 minutes and the registered provider key is a Pi `!command`, so request-time auth resolves a fresh token when Pi sends model requests.

## LiteLLM MCP tools

If your LiteLLM proxy exposes MCP REST endpoints, this extension discovers tools from:

- `GET /mcp-rest/tools/list`
- `POST /mcp-rest/tools/call`

Each discovered tool is registered as a native Pi tool named `mcp_<server>_<tool>`, with simple JSON Schema parameters mapped to Pi/TypeBox parameters. Complex schemas fall back to a single `args` object. MCP discovery runs after Pi refreshes LiteLLM models or after `/login litellm`; extension activation never waits for it. MCP tools run in Pi's parallel tool mode and retry transient failures once.

## LiteLLM Skill Hub

If your LiteLLM proxy exposes `/claude-code/marketplace.json`, enabled skills are fetched before each agent turn and appended to the system prompt as a `litellm_skills` section. The extension falls back to the legacy `/v1/skills` Skills Gateway path when Skill Hub is unavailable. It also registers Pi tools for basic skill management:

- `litellm_skill_list`
- `litellm_skill_create`
- `litellm_skill_delete`

## Mocked LiteLLM smoke workflow

The `LiteLLM Smoke` GitHub Actions workflow starts VidaiMock and a real LiteLLM proxy on the runner. LiteLLM exposes OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic routes whose upstreams are served by VidaiMock, then this extension's smoke runner discovers those models through LiteLLM and sends `/v1/chat/completions` requests through the proxy.

This keeps the LiteLLM integration path under test but does not call real LLM APIs. No provider API keys or GitHub Models permission are required. The smoke runner also asserts that discovery came from `/model/info` (`LITELLM_SMOKE_EXPECT_SOURCE`) so a silent fallback to `/v1/models` fails the run. The workflow also runs auth checks plus optional Postgres-backed auth checks when `LITELLM_LICENSE` is configured for virtual-key and admin-route behavior, then runs a non-interactive Pi CLI smoke with `--list-models` and `-p` against both the OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-backed routes, so extension loading, model discovery, and real completion paths are covered without opening the TUI. It also runs an interactive Pi TUI smoke covering `/login litellm` and Pi's native `/model` refresh. One route is configured as two deployments sharing a `model_name`, so the workflow proves LiteLLM really returns a row per deployment carrying `model_info.id`, `mode`, `supported_openai_params`, and `allowed_openai_params` — the upstream contract deployment-group reduction depends on.

## Development

This package requires Node.js `>=22.19.0`. CI currently uses Node `26.5.0`.

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
npm run clean && npm run build
```

`npm run check` runs Biome, type checking, and the Vitest suite. Runtime changes must be built before local Pi smoke checks because the extension entrypoint is `./dist/index.js`.

Before changing package contents or dependency policy, also run:

```bash
npm run supply-chain:guard
npm pack --dry-run
```

The published npm package should contain only `dist`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`.

## Release

Releases are driven by semver tags named `v*.*.*`. The GitHub release workflow installs from the lockfile, runs the checks, builds `dist`, verifies the package tarball, publishes to npm with provenance, and creates a GitHub release.

Before tagging a release, keep `package.json` and `package-lock.json` versions in sync and verify the dry-run package contents.

## Model catalog

Dynamic catalogs are persisted by Pi in `~/.pi/agent/models-store.json`. Credentials remain in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`. Legacy `litellm-models*.json` files are ignored and are not deleted.

Opening `/model` refreshes configured provider catalogs in the background using Pi's native model lifecycle.

### Deployment groups and metadata evidence

`/model/info` returns one row per deployment, so several rows can share a `model_name`. Those rows are reduced to a single model using the least capable value from each deployment: the smallest context window and max tokens, the highest price, vision and reasoning only when every deployment reports them, and Pi catalog metadata only when the deployments agree on which backend serves the route.

Reasoning controls come from deployment evidence rather than the route name, and no thinking level is ever offered that the model's compatibility settings cannot actually put on the wire.

For backends whose reasoning contract is recognized — the Kimi K2.5/K2.6, K2.7 Code and K3 generations, and DeepSeek V4 — a level is offered only when a deployment parameter can carry it. The carrying parameter is generation-specific, and **every** deployment in the group must declare it, because the group reduces to the parameters they all accept:

| Recognized backend | Carrying parameter |
|---|---|
| Kimi K2.5 / K2.6 | `thinking` |
| Kimi K2.7 Code | `thinking` (thinking cannot be switched off) |
| Kimi K3 | `reasoning_effort` |
| DeepSeek V4 | `thinking`, `reasoning_effort`, or both |

Without that evidence the route is reported as reasoning-capable with no selectable level, rather than offering levels that would be silently dropped. Other Kimi generations have no recognized contract, so they fail closed the same way; a carrier is never guessed from the route name or from vendor documentation. Backends outside these families keep whatever the Pi catalog describes and use the standard `reasoning_effort` field.

Declaring the parameter your backend accepts, on every deployment of the route, is the config-side fix.

Two suffixes can appear in a displayed model name:

| Suffix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `(no metadata)` | Single deployment with incomplete pricing and no catalog match. Enriched from the Pi catalog later if the id becomes resolvable. |
| `(incomplete metadata)` | Several deployments with incomplete pricing. Kept as the conservative floor and never enriched, because one deployment's metadata cannot speak for the group. |

Catalog enrichment needs a provider it can trust: the `owned_by` field, a provider-qualified id such as `openai/gpt-5.5`, or the deployment's `litellm_params.model`. Recognized Anthropic aliases (`sonnet-4-6`, `opus-5`, dated snapshots) are also resolved, because they canonicalize onto a single Anthropic catalog id.

A route name is used only as a last-resort fallback, never to override deployment evidence: it applies when a route reduces to exactly one deployment and nothing else identified the backend. A route named only `mistral-large-latest` matches no catalog id and stays on conservative defaults. When deployments disagree about which backend serves a route — or when only some of them identify one — catalog limits, pricing, and reasoning metadata are withheld for the whole group and the downgrade is reported on stderr.

Discovery falls back from `/model/info` to `/v1/models` to `/health`, and capability shrinks along that path because the available evidence does. Only `/model/info` exposes complete deployment groups; `/health` reports one deployment at a time and is not reduced across a route's deployments, so a multi-deployment route discovered that way reflects whichever deployment `/health` listed first. Prefer a key that can read `/model/info` when reasoning controls matter.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| "no credentials" warning at startup | Env vars not set and no OAuth credential — run `/login litellm` |
| "discovered no models" | Proxy returned an empty list — check pi's startup log and verify `/model/info`, `/v1/models`, or `/health` responds |
| `/model/info` returning 401/403/404 | Expected behavior with virtual keys — extension falls back to `/v1/models` |
| Discovery times out | Increase `LITELLM_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` or set `LITELLM_OFFLINE=1` to fall back on cached models |
| Model shows as reasoning-capable but no thinking level can be selected | The route has no usable reasoning-control evidence. For a recognized backend, add its carrying parameter (see [the table above](#deployment-groups-and-metadata-evidence)) to `supported_openai_params` or `allowed_openai_params` on **every** deployment of the route. Other backends have no recognized contract and stay closed by design |
| Model name ends in `(no metadata)` or `(incomplete metadata)` | Deployment pricing is incomplete and no catalog entry matched — see [Deployment groups and metadata evidence](#deployment-groups-and-metadata-evidence) |
| `401 Token expired` | Set `LITELLM_API_KEY_HELPER`. |
| No models with gcloud auth | Verify `gcloud auth application-default login` has been run or set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to an `authorized_user` ADC file |
| Enterprise SSO login shows "virtual key generation failed" | The LiteLLM instance may lack a database (`/key/generate` requires one), your user account may lack key-generation permission, or the request timed out; the JWT is used directly as a fallback |
| Enterprise SSO token prompt fails with "SSO token is required" | The token field was left empty — paste the token copied from the LiteLLM UI |
| MCP tools not showing | Verify the proxy exposes `/mcp-rest/tools/list` and open `/model` after fixing the proxy |
| Skills not affecting prompts | Verify the proxy exposes `/claude-code/marketplace.json` or `/v1/skills` and returns enabled skills |
